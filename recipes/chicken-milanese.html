    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Milanese is a classic Italian dish featuring tender chicken cutlets coated in breadcrumbs, pan-fried until crispy, and served with a refreshing arugula salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large chicken breasts, butterflied and pounded thin</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups arugula</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil, for salad</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken cutlet in flour, shaking off excess. Dip it into the eggs, then coat it with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing lightly to adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the breaded chicken cutlets and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, toss the arugula with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken cutlets with the arugula salad and lemon wedges on the side.</li>
      </ol>
